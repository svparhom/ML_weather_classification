# ML_weather_classification
In this training project I will use Python Scikit-learn library to perform a decision tree based classification of weather data.

The goal is to train and to test a model with further evaluation of accuracy. 

The data comes from a weather station located in San Diego, California. The weather station is equipped with sensors that capture weather-related measurements such as air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. Data was collected for a period of three years, from September 2011 to September 2014, to ensure that sufficient data for different seasons and weather conditions is captured.
